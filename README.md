# ValidateObject - ChatGPT / Semantic Kernel Plugin


**ValidateObject** is a powerful tool introduced for the SK Hackathon #1, hosted by Microsoft. [Learn more about the hackathon](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/semantic-kernel/%F0%9F%93%A2-announcing-the-semantic-kernel-plugins-hackathon/).

## Overview

**ValidateObject** is an essential component designed to work seamlessly with chatGPT and Semantic Kernel. Its primary function is to validate the format of an object. As we navigate the complex world of language models, particularly in the context of the Schillace Laws, especially under the `Trade-offs And Challenges When Using LLMs` group (as introduced by John Maede), ensuring the intersection between the model and conventional code is error-free can be quite challenging. 

Our blog post, [Schillace Laws: Part 3](https://appstream.studio/blog/schillace-laws-part-3), delves deeper into this topic, highlighting the importance of validation in building robust systems.

## Key Features

**ValidateObject** addresses the following critical aspects:

1. **Format Validation:** Ensure the correctness of the object format, whether it's XML or JSON.

2. **Schema Validation:** Verify that the object not only conforms to the correct format but also aligns with the provided schema (XML or JSON).

3. **Structure Alignment:** Check whether the object's structure (XML or JSON) is consistent with the format of the example object (XML or JSON).

## Why Use ValidateObject?

Using large language models (LLMs) involves striking a balance between leverage and precision. To mitigate the risks of building a brittle system, it's essential to have a diverse toolbox at your disposal. **ValidateObject** provides you with an additional tool to confidently address these challenges.
